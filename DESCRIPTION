Description: Implements a manifold dimension reuduction algorithm based on work
    of Chigirev and Bialek (NIPS 2004). This takes arbitrary dimension data and
    tries to move the points onto a lower dimensional manifold using an
    information theoretic approach. This implementation is based on Matlab code
    originally due to Nick Masse and Gregory Jefferis.
